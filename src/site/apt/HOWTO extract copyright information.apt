HOWTO extract copyright information

  The following commands gather all the tab-delimited text files that were 
  generated with the annotation processors during the process-class phase:

  * Mixed copyright:

+---
  ZIP="/tmp/copyright-mixed.zip"; rm -f $ZIP; zip -j $ZIP `find -name "*copyright-mixed*" | grep -v "checkout"`
+---

  * 3rd-party copyright:

+---
  ZIP="/tmp/copyright-3rdparty.zip"; rm -f $ZIP; zip -j $ZIP `find -name "*copyright-3rd*" | grep -v "checkout"`
+---
