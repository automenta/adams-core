 * Attempts to free up memory of the sub-flow that it belongs to.<br/>
 * This actor is useful in case when sub-flows are only executed once, but still keep their data-structures and gobble up unnecessary memory. One scenario is having a adams.flow.control.Branch actor with lots of sequences as branches, which only get executed once.<br/>
 * The parent must implement adams.flow.core.SubFlowWrapUp in order for this to work.<br/>
 * CAUTION: Behind the scenes, all actors below this actor's parent will call their wrapUp() methods to conserve space. Therefore, use this actor with caution, as it will basically reset the actors.
